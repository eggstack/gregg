# Gregg plan index

This directory contains Gregg's implementation roadmaps and execution-ready plans.

## Current direction

Gregg remains a small local/LAN system monitor:

- native Linux, macOS, and Windows metric collection;
- a cached read-only JSON daemon API;
- a compact terminal client for a small fleet;
- optional bounded EggPool summary integration;
- local-first verification and manual releases;
- no generalized observability platform, public-internet service, release orchestration, or evidence system.

Local tests remain the primary development path. The one existing GitHub Actions workflow provides Linux checks and native macOS/Windows truth. CI does not publish crates, create releases, upload artifacts, or enforce binary-size gates.

## Roadmap status

Plans 066-075 are complete. Plan 076 implemented the Unix runtime/service-manager separation, HTTP `croncheck`, config-only Unix mutation, and explicit version commands. Plan 077 is the active narrow corrective pass for strict bounded status-line parsing, missing negative-path tests, stale disabled-test cleanup, and truthful Plan 076 closure.

| Plan | Purpose | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`066-bounded-correctness-and-maintainability-roadmap.md`](066-bounded-correctness-and-maintainability-roadmap.md) | Correct concrete cross-platform defects, retain only justified simplification, and close through bounded verification | complete through 074; CI-backed Windows SCM verification passed |
| [`067-truthful-drive-capacity-semantics.md`](067-truthful-drive-capacity-semantics.md) | Preserve truthful used, free, and caller-available drive capacity | complete |
| [`068-coherent-daemon-state-and-health.md`](068-coherent-daemon-state-and-health.md) | Publish one coherent daemon state and truthful health responses | complete |
| [`069-daemon-cli-runtime-and-test-correctness.md`](069-daemon-cli-runtime-and-test-correctness.md) | Correct config intent, runtime/error boundaries, exit codes, and omitted tests | complete |
| [`070-bounded-client-async-simplification.md`](070-bounded-client-async-simplification.md) | Retain scheduler or EggPool simplification only when smaller and behavior-preserving | complete; no change |
| [`071-measured-footprint-and-lightweight-closure.md`](071-measured-footprint-and-lightweight-closure.md) | Measure safe manifest/profile reductions and retain only verified improvements | complete |
| [`072-windows-service-runtime-and-record-correction.md`](072-windows-service-runtime-and-record-correction.md) | Correct Windows service runtime ownership and nonblocking shutdown | complete |
| [`073-native-windows-scm-entry-and-readiness-correction.md`](073-native-windows-scm-entry-and-readiness-correction.md) | Add native SCM dispatcher/`ServiceMain`, config handoff, and post-bind readiness | complete; operationally verified by 074 |
| [`074-ci-backed-windows-scm-closure.md`](074-ci-backed-windows-scm-closure.md) | Correct the Windows lifecycle smoke and run it in the existing Windows CI job | complete; run `31040689848` passed |
| [`075-configured-name-and-windows-hostname-correction.md`](075-configured-name-and-windows-hostname-correction.md) | Remove the native Windows hostname NUL and honor configured daemon names in foreground and SCM modes | complete; CI run `31189587467` |
| [`076-native-runtime-croncheck-and-version-correction.md`](076-native-runtime-croncheck-and-version-correction.md) | Separate Unix foreground runtime, health probing, config mutation, and version commands | implemented; local workspace and Ubuntu E2E checks passed; strict parser/test closure continues in 077 |
| [`077-croncheck-strictness-test-cleanup-and-plan076-closure.md`](077-croncheck-strictness-test-cleanup-and-plan076-closure.md) | Bound and tighten `croncheck` status parsing, remove stale disabled tests, and close Plan 076 truthfully | planned / active |

Dependency order:

```text
066 -> 067 -> 068 -> 069 -> 070 -> 071 -> 072 -> 073 -> 074 -> 075 -> 076 -> 077
```

Plan 076 is concrete product-correctness work, not a closure-only record. Plan 077 is the single narrow corrective pass discovered during review of that implementation. Do not add another closure-only phase after 077 if its acceptance criteria pass.

## Execution record for Plan 075

Execution completed:

1. Inspected the existing Windows source, startup paths, foreground smoke, SCM smoke, and relevant documentation.
2. Kept the completed SCM dispatcher, runtime ownership, readiness, and CI architecture unchanged.
3. Truncated `GetComputerNameExW` output using the successful call's returned UTF-16 length.
4. Passed `Some(config.name.as_str())` into native collector construction in foreground and SCM modes.
5. Strengthened the existing Windows foreground and SCM smoke assertions without adding a test harness.
6. Ran focused tests, the default and release local checks, exact Linux CI gates, Rust 1.75 compilation, and one ordinary existing CI run.
7. Recorded the green implementation SHA and workflow run in Plan 075; no corrective phase remained for the Plan 075 scope.

## Verification model

Routine development:

```bash
./scripts/check-local.sh
```

Manual release preflight remains:

```bash
./scripts/check-local.sh --release
```

For Plan 077, focused local verification is sufficient:

```text
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo test -p greggd cli
cargo test -p greggd --bin greggd
cargo test -p greggd
./scripts/check-local.sh
```

Plan 077 additionally requires one narrow local Ubuntu live/dead `croncheck` smoke with the release daemon. It must not be moved into CI.

The existing Windows CI job remains the authoritative native Windows environment for Windows-specific SCM behavior and continues to run its existing checks. Plan 077 does not change or add CI coverage.

A plan does not require:

- a dedicated qualification workflow;
- a second Windows job or matrix;
- a self-hosted or privileged runner;
- uploaded artifacts, logs, screenshots, or evidence bundles;
- immutable candidate SHAs or repeated green runs;
- crates.io publication, tags, or GitHub Releases.

## Completion rule

A phase is complete only when its explicit acceptance criteria are implemented and demonstrated by the lightest appropriate mechanism:

- deterministic unit/integration tests;
- the default local check;
- the release preflight only for release-facing changes;
- native platform CI only where native-platform truth is actually required;
- direct local operational smoke where explicitly required;
- direct documentation inspection for scope and behavior claims.

Do not check boxes based on comments, intent, compilation alone, or an earlier commit that no longer matches HEAD.

## Scope control for Plan 077

Allowed:

- a fixed-size `croncheck` HTTP status-line read;
- strict CRLF, EOF, HTTP/1.0-or-1.1, and status-code handling;
- focused malformed/overlong/refused-port tests;
- deletion of the always-false legacy daemon CLI test module;
- minimal retention/adaptation of non-duplicated current-contract config/error tests;
- one local Ubuntu live/dead `croncheck` smoke;
- direct closure updates to Plans 076-077 and this index.

Not allowed:

- a new HTTP client dependency or general-purpose parser;
- retries, TLS, HTTP/2, auth, or protocol changes;
- systemd/launchd runtime restoration, self-daemonization, PID files, or process discovery;
- changes to Windows SCM lifecycle behavior;
- broad test-suite restructuring;
- new workflows, jobs, matrices, artifacts, evidence bundles, or CI gates;
- unrelated collector, TUI, EggPool, drive, release, or packaging work;
- a Plan 078 created only to mark 077 complete.
